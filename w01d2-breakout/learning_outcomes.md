# Learning Outcomes

1. Reading Code
  * In this breakout we'll practice reading and evaluating pre-written code in our head. Developers don't read code top to bottom, and instead in some ways try to mimic the computer.

2. Scopes
  * Scopes and how they work through Functions.
  * "The scope chain" and being able to identify different levels of scopes in JavaScript.
